This repository hosts the content used for the hands-on sessions of "Machine Learning and Data Visualization" during the OHBM Brainhack 2021.

We will delve into using the Python programming language to fit various machine learning models on a sample neuroimaging dataset. We'll be using tools from numpy, pandas, and sklearn packages to read the input data, modify it and extract informative knowledge using the machine learning models. Thereafter, we'll use the visualization tools at our disposal to make sense of the fitted models. These visualizations can come in handy for translating our findings into a clarified figure that summarizes our conclusions.

While an elementary knowledge of the python programming language or familiarity with programming languages in general is anticipated, you are not required to have any tools installed to attend this session. We'll conduct all of our analysis on the cloud and in a simple step-by-step tutorial that can assist individuals who are new to programming.

Goals:

The main goal of this session is to get acquainted with the publicly available python tools that can aid your future scientific discoveries. Namely, we'll explore using different functions from commonly used python packages (numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, nilearn). We'll explore how these tools can help us in extracting knowledge from raw data using methods of machine learning and data visualization.

This session is divided into the following sections:
